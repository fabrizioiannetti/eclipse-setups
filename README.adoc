= eclipse-setups

These are my setups to use with eclipse installer

== Minimal

+fabsetups/fab-default.setup+ is a minimal eclipse install that provides:

* Eclipse features
** Only simple projects
** EGit
** Mylyn
** Mylyn docs
** Mylyn github
** Mylyn gerrit
** Oomph OS Tools (Open shell/file browser)
* my own:
** Text Editor Grep
** Large file editor

Provided in two versions:

* Neon
* Latest (Oxygen)

I intend to use this as a PIM, by keeping all my notes as asciidoc files in a git repository.
This way I can version all my notes and also have multiple copies on my computers that I can
easily synchronise via EGit.
